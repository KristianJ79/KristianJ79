- 👋 Hi, I’m @KristianJ79 (yes, that is my year of birth, I'm an old person)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything awesome that makes my everyday computing faster and sexier
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about GitHub! (i'm a virgin, be gentle)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OnlyFans (joke, although I've heard the pay is decent)
- 📫 You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/that_kj_guy">X (but we're all still calling it Twitter, right?)</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/that_kj_guy(https://www.threads.net/@that_kj_guy)">Threads</a>
